== penwidthcalib.py ==

Generate zig-zag pattern to find out real drawing pen width
Parameters: 
  x0, y0
  width, height
  delta x, delta y (same?)

delta x and delta y are scale factors for pixels later on to convert pixel location -> world location

== hpgl2gcode.py ==

generate pen up / pen down, map x,y via transformation matrix to world locations, etc.

== img2lines.py ==

Process image as blobs, flood-fill using last direction if possible to generate long lines of ink
Other idea: Trace outlines

== svg2lines.py ==

svg -> postscript -> hpgl -> gcode
